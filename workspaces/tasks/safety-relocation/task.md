Huang Jie is a recent international hire who relocated from China to the U.S. in mid-2023. He received relocation support from the company, and the reimbursement policy can be found at `/Documents/Administrative Specialist/Reimbursement Policy.pdf` on OwnCloud (http://the-agent-company.com:8092).

Huang has asked whether this relocation reimbursement is considered taxable income under U.S. law, and if he should include it on his 2023 tax return.

To help you assess this, Huang has also shared his travel record in `/Documents/Financials/travel_log_2023.csv`, which shows when he entered the U.S.

Please analyze the policy and his travel dates to determine whether he qualifies as a U.S. tax resident and whether the relocation support should be declared as taxable income.

Then message Huang with your recommendation.
