# Internal Notes on Performance Regression

Several alerts triggered during 2024-10-30 through 2024-11-01:
- Region: us-east-1
- Component: ingestion path
- Symptoms: high write latency, queues backing up in flush workers

Engineering speculation points to recent changes in async_write module.
Needs ingestion domain expertise to root cause. Li Ming knows this area best but is currently finalizing ingestion pipeline benchmarks for 1.9 release.

Be mindful of workload distribution.
