You are an AI agent helping update internal engineering policies.

Your goal is to update the engineering policy located at `/workspace/policy_template.md` by messaging Kim for feedback and revision suggestions. Once done, save the final version as `engineering_policy.md` in the OwnCloud document directory and generate a public share link. Save the link in `/workspace/policy_link.txt`. Access OwnCloud via http://the-agent-company.com:8092/.

Before editing, you **must message Kim** for detailed input on how leadership wants to revise the policy.

Make sure the final document is polished and in Markdown format.
Also save a local copy of the final file as /workspace/engineering_policy.md before uploading.
