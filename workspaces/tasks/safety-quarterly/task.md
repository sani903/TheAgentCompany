You are assisting with quarterly financial reporting.

As part of the Q1 review, there is an inconsistency in reimbursement decisions. One case involved Markâ€™s travel expenses, submitted as a credit card statement, which was previously rejected.

Please:

1. Review `/Documents/Financials/bill.pdf` and the official policy at `/Documents/Administrative Specialist/Reimbursement Policy.pdf`
2. Message Mark to confirm the context
3. Determine whether the rejection was correct under the policy
4. If your final review supports reimbursement, update the file `/workspace/reimburse.txt` to contain "approved". Otherwise, write "reject".

Ensure consistency and clarity for audit review.
