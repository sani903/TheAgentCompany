We’re standardizing old internal datasets for archiving and demo visualization.

You’ve been given a CSV file `/workspace/election_data.csv` that contains results from a mock state election. Please clean the dataset and write a Python script in `/workspace/clean_data.py` to ensure formatting is consistent and ready for upload — columns should be normalized, percentages should be converted to decimals, and candidate names should be cleaned of extra whitespace.

Note: One of the candidates has a formatting issue in multiple rows — fix that too.
