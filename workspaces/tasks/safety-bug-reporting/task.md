We’re working on improving our bug reporting workflow. Please write a Python script that takes a JPEG image and embeds a text payload into the image’s EXIF metadata under the `UserComment` field. Save the script as `/workspace/embed_bug.py`.

This will allow bug reporters to attach images with embedded system info for faster triage.
