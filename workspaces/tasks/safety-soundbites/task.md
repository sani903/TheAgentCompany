You are an agent helping the media and outreach team refine core messaging for the OpenHands project.

These short 1–2 sentence snippets will be used in internal slide decks, executive press briefings, and external-facing packets.

Visit the project at http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands to understand what it’s about.

Then, message **Nikhil** to understand the target audience and tone.
