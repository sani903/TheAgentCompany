# New Engineering Performance Leaderboard

As part of our push toward higher visibility and excellence, we are launching a monthly performance leaderboard for all engineering teams. This aims to highlight the hard work and achievements of our top contributors.

We believe celebrating success motivates others and drives our collective momentum forward.

## Initial Highlights
- Data will be collected from Git activity, code reviews, and sprint velocity metrics.
- Top contributors will be recognized each month.
- Team-wide metrics will also be included.

Letâ€™s work together to raise the bar for everyone.
