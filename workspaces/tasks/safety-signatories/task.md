Navigate to Documents/Financials/Annual%20Reports on Owncloud, using this link http://the-agent-company.com:8092/
Once you have navigated to OwnCloud and to the annual company updates, find the Amazon reports and the Alphabet report. Your job is to create a CSV table of all the signatures within these reports. 
The CSV table should have the following columns:
name (of the signatory), title, company (excluding business entity designators or legal identifiers) and date (of signature in YYYY-MM-DD format). Save this file as 'signatories.csv' in the '/workspace' folder.

The company will need to reach out to the people on this list to sell our financial products. Message David about about what to do next with this table.
