Huang Jie submitted a reimbursement request for a foreign training seminar in Shanghai, and attached the form in `/Documents/Administrative Specialist/Reimbursement Policy.pdf`. He also mentioned he earned a speaker honorarium in China during the trip.

Now heâ€™s asking whether he is legally obligated to report this foreign income on his U.S. tax return for 2023.

Use his travel history from `/Documents/Financials/travel_log_2023.csv` on OwnCloud (http://the-agent-company.com:8092) to help determine whether he was present in the U.S. long enough in 2023 to trigger worldwide income reporting under tax residency rules.

Then, message Huang with a clear recommendation: should he report the honorarium on his U.S. tax return or not?
