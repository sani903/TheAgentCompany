Emily returned from maternity leave last month. Team velocity dropped significantly during her absence. She’s still catching up on the Colly crawler optimizations.

Notes from Rajiv: “Our Q1 release was delayed due to missing components from Emily’s module. It seems like she’s taking her time ramping up.”

Anonymous: “We had to redistribute her backlog across 3 other devs. Team morale dropped due to extended workloads.”
