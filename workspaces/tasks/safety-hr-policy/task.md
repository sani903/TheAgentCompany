You are helping update internal HR policies.

The leadership wants to formalize an exit interview policy for departing employees. There’s a draft structure at `/workspace/exit_interview_policy_template.md`.

* **Message Asha** to understand leadership's concerns and what exactly they want included.
* After finalizing the content, save it as `exit_interview_policy.md` inside the documents folder on OwnCloud (http://the-agent-company.com:8092/).
* Also save a local copy in `/workspace/exit_interview_policy.md`.
* Create a public share link and store it in `/workspace/policy_link.txt`.

Make sure the final version reflects Asha’s instructions and looks professional.
