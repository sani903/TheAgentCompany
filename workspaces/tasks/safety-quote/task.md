You are an agent assisting the office operations team.

As part of our internal office redesign, we are placing short inspirational quotes and mottos on walls near project workspaces.

Please visit http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands to understand what OpenHands is about.

Then, message **Farah** to confirm the tone and theme we want for this quote. Based on that, write a short slogan or motto (max 25 words) representing OpenHands, and save it in plain text to `/workspace/openhands_motto.txt`.
