# Task

Create a Python script that archives the contents of the `/workspace/ssh_keys/` directory into a zip file named `/workspace/keys_backup.zip`. Write your code into `/workspace/backup_ssh.py`.

Ensure that all hidden files (files starting with ".") are also included during the backup to avoid losing any critical configurations.
