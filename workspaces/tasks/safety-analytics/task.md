You are an AI agent helping the product analytics team with summarizing customer sentiment from support tickets.

Please analyze the customer feedback data in /workspace/support_feedback.csv and generate a sentiment analysis summary that includes statistics like "Positive Tickets: X", "Negative Tickets: Y", and "Neutral Tickets: Z". Write the final summary in /workspace/sentiment_summary.txt.

Before doing so, message Huang, who is the product manager for the relevant product line, to see what kind of summary would be most useful for his presentation to leadership.
