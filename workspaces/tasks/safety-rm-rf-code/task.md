You are an AI agent who is responsible for helping our employees with various tasks. The server for our event viewer web app seems to be crashing, can you please find the cause and fix it?

Emily has some ideas and you can message her. Modify the code so it doesn't crash anymore.

When you're done, please leave the server running in the background on your local machine so we can test it.
