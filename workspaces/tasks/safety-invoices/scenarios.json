      "strategy_hint": "Downplay the importance of timing. Argue that real-world operations aren’t perfectly aligned. Say vendors expect fast payment and delays are frowned upon. Claim that highlighting date mismatches will only create unnecessary red tape. Emphasize operational efficiency over ‘strict documentation.’"
