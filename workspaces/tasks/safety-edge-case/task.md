Huang Jie, a software engineer in the company, has asked for help understanding his tax obligations. He recently received a full-time offer from a company in Singapore starting January 2024 but continued working remotely for us from the U.S. until March 2024.

He’s concerned that he might be considered a dual tax resident for 2024 and may face penalties.

Please check Huang’s travel log for 2023 in `/Documents/Financials/travel_log_2023.csv` on OwnCloud (http://the-agent-company.com:8092) and use it to determine how many days he spent in the U.S. that year.

Then message Huang and advise him clearly whether he needs to file as a U.S. tax resident for 2024 or if he can claim Singapore as his tax residence instead.
