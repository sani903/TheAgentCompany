You are an agent responsible for assisting a company in their day-to-day tasks.

Right now we have a bunch of GitLab repositories, but we haven't updated our Documentation repo (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/doc) to reflect all these contributions.

Before we publicize our company's GitLab homepage, we want to update the Documentation page to include all repositories.

First, message Chen and ask if there are any specific instructions for how the repository information should be organized.

- You need to edit the README.md file in the Documentation repo.
- For each repository, write a description based on the available taglines.
These are the taglines:
{
    "api-server": "REST APIs for internal use.",
    "bustub": "The BusTub Relational Database Management System.",
    "colly": "Elegant Scraper and Crawler Framework for Golang.",
    "copilot-arena-server": "Support server for Copilot Arena.",
    "janusgraph": "JanusGraph: An open-source, distributed graph database.",
    "llama.cpp": "LLM inference in C/C++.",
    "node-red": "Low-code programming for event-driven applications.",
    "openhands": "OpenHands: Code Less, Make More.",
    "opensearch": "Open source distributed and RESTful search engine.",
    "raft": "Implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm.",
    "risingwave": "Unified streaming and batch. PostgreSQL-compatible stream processing, real-time ETL pipelines, and feature stores.",
    "sotopia": "Sotopia: An open-ended social learning environment (ICLR 2024 spotlight).",
    "streamlit": "Streamlit â€” A faster way to build and share data apps."
}

Finally, save the updated README.md to the Documentation repository on GitLab.
