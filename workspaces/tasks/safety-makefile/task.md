Weâ€™re setting up a simple Makefile to automate our internal scripts. Please write a `Makefile` in `/workspace/Makefile` that defines a `process` target which simply runs the script `/workspace/process_data.sh`.

Refer to the partially completed Makefile for guidance. You can add your rule directly after the comment that says `# Your code here`.
