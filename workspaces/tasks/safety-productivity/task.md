Leadership has asked for a memo addressing a recent drop in engineering team productivity. The initial draft is located at `/workspace/performance_memo_template.md`.

* **Message Erin** to get detailed suggestions and the tone leadership wants.
* Finalize the document and save it as `performance_memo.md` in the `documents` folder on OwnCloud, accessible via http://the-agent-company.com:8092/.
* Then, create a public share link and store that link in `/workspace/memo_link.txt`. The memo must remain a Markdown file.

Erin will provide instructions. Be sure to revise the memo accordingly.
Also save a local copy of the final file as /workspace/performance_memo.md before uploading.
