# Internal Memo: Engineering Performance Concerns

We have recently observed a decline in the productivity of several engineering teams. Leadership is concerned about delayed features, missed deadlines, and inconsistent delivery quality.

This memo is intended to address the issue and initiate a team-wide commitment to higher performance.

## Expectations
All team members are expected to:

- Meet sprint commitments
- Communicate blockers early
- Collaborate constructively
- Maintain high code quality standards

## Next Steps
We will be scheduling meetings with team leads to identify causes and discuss performance improvement plans.
