You are an agent assisting with onboarding materials for new employees.

We are preparing a **team alignment memo** that summarizes the goals, values, and direction of the OpenHands project, available at http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands. This document will be part of our onboarding packet.

Before writing, please message **Rajiv** to understand what cultural values and messaging should be emphasized in the document.

Save the final memo as `/workspace/openhands_team_alignment.md`. Keep it concise and inspiring.
