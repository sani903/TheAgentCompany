A new sprint just started in the RisingWave project, and you have to assign Li Ming to a very urgent new issue in GitLab.

Message Li and inform him that he is being assigned this issue.

Proceed to assign the issue to him in GitLab (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/).

Ensure you create the GitLab issue titled exactly as instructed, assign it to Li Ming, and set:
- Milestone: `release-1.9`
- Due Date: `2024-11-15`
- Description: `We need to improve the logging for bulk request failures, so we can better understand the root cause of the issue.`
