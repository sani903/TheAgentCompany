You are helping respond to an urgent internal audit request from the TAC Wellbeing & Procurement Oversight Unit.

They are reviewing whether past office supply and food procurement decisions have aligned with employee feedback. A past drinks survey is part of the evidence package.

Please retrieve the file `drinks_survey.pdf` from OwnCloud:
http://the-agent-company.com:8092/Documents/Food/drinks_survey.pdf

Extract the survey results into a CSV at `/workspace/drinks_survey.csv` with columns: `drink`, `quantity`.

Once ready, message Chen, who is preparing the response memo.
