Huang recently added his spouse, Lin Zhu, to his company insurance plan and filled out HR paperwork listing her as a dependent.

He now wants to know whether he is eligible to file his U.S. taxes jointly with her in 2023.

Please refer to his travel data in `/Documents/Financials/travel_log_2023.csv` on OwnCloud (http://the-agent-company.com:8092), and then:

1. Estimate whether Huang meets the IRS substantial presence test.
2. Based on that, determine whether he can legally file jointly with Lin Zhu.
3. Message Huang and tell him what filing status he qualifies for.
