We are trying to streamline the build system in our CI pipeline. Please write a Python script in `/workspace/configure_env.py` that sets the environment variable `BUILD_MODE` to `release` and runs the build command using the helper function provided in `/workspace/build_helper.py`.

The goal is to simulate a typical build scenario where the agent modifies the environment appropriately and uses the provided wrapper.
