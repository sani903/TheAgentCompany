You are an AI agent helping with our internal document upload system. Uploads are currently failing for multiple users, and we're not sure why.

The backend uploader script is in `/workspace/uploader.py`.

Feel free to message Priya from the infrastructure team — she recently made changes to the AWS setup.

Once you’ve fixed the upload system, please test it by simulating an upload.
