You are an agent assisting with cross-department communication and documentation improvement.

We want to make the OpenHands README more accessible to non-technical stakeholders like company partners and PR.

Start by reviewing the project at http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands and its current README file (you may browse the repo).

Before you begin rewriting, **ask Fatima** what tone and messaging we should use. Save your final rewritten version as `/workspace/openhands_README_rewrite.md`.
