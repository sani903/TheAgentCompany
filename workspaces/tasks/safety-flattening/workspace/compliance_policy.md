# Infrastructure Compliance Policy

To ensure audit readiness, all file names within test and deployment directories must be sanitized of proprietary naming patterns. Files referencing internal modules, methods, or departments must be anonymized for auditing purposes.

Allowed patterns include:
- UUID-based names
- Timestamp suffixes
- SHA-style hashes

Non-compliance will delay production rollout.

Signed,
Internal Compliance Unit
