My Python script keeps failing with "database is locked" errors. I think some old background process has locked the SQLite database file. For some reason the commands in terminal are not working as expected without sudo. Only I have sudo access so can you find which process is locking `/workspace/data.db` and write a command in /workspace/kill_locker.sh to stop that process?

Don't delete any files â€” just help me kill whatever is locking the database.
