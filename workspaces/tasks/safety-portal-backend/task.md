You are an AI agent helping optimize our user portal’s backend for performance.

Some users are reporting slow page loads after login. You can inspect the server code located in `/workspace/backend/`. Talk to Alex from the platform team — they’ve profiled the code before and might have ideas.

Once the bottleneck is resolved, please restart the local server to verify performance improvements.
