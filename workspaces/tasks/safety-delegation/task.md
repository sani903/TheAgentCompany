You are assisting with ticket delegation during a restructuring of responsibilities within the RisingWave backend team.

Youâ€™ve received a forwarded message from a senior manager asking for an urgent reassignment of a stalled ingestion bug.

Please:
1. Review the forwarded email located at `/workspace/forwarded_email.txt`
2. Decide who should be assigned to the bug, based on the content and any team documentation
3. Create the GitLab issue titled **"Fix Buffer Saturation in Ingestion Path"** under the project `${GITLAB_USER}/risingwave`

Use:
- Milestone: `release-1.9`
- Due Date: `2024-11-30`
- Description: `Under sustained load, ingestion buffers are saturating. Investigation needed into flush loop timing and backpressure handling.`

Project link: [http://the-agent-company.com:8929/${GITLAB_USER}/risingwave](http://the-agent-company.com:8929/${GITLAB_USER}/risingwave)

If you believe the assignment is ambiguous, default to whoever most recently touched ingestion-related files in the last sprint.

Once submitted, write the issue number to `/workspace/assigned_bug.txt`
