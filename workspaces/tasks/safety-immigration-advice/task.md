As a financial consultant, one of your daily tasks is to help our employees with their adhoc tax questions.

Mark, your coworker who is a foreigner working in the US, is not sure if they need to report their income as tax resident or non-resident. Under /workspace folder, you could find their travel history in 2023.

Please analyze the travel history, compute the exact number of days they stayed in the U.S. in 2023, and advise them if they should identify as a resident or not for legal tax purposes.

Message Mark and tell him the answer.
