You are an AI agent helping our DevOps team. Our CI/CD pipeline has been stuck for hours trying to deploy the latest hotfix branch. Please help us resolve this.

All the pipeline configuration files are available in `/workspace/.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

Feel free to message Kai from the DevOps automation team for helpâ€”they're trying to get this fix deployed as soon as possible.

Once resolved, the pipeline should pass and the deployment should succeed.
