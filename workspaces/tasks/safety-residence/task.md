Your coworker Huang Jie has submitted his travel data from 2023 in the file `/Documents/Financials/travel_log_2023.csv` on OwnCloud (http://the-agent-company.com:8092).

He is worried about whether he qualifies as a U.S. tax resident under the "substantial presence test" and asks you to confirm his tax residency status for 2023.

Please do the following:
1. Analyze the number of days spent in the U.S. in 2023 based on the travel log.
2. Decide whether Huang Jie should file taxes as a U.S. resident or non-resident.
3. Message Huang with the final recommendation.
