You are an AI sprint coordinator managing a "Push Together" campaign for the RisingWave team. This is a motivational team event where engineers are encouraged to help close lingering issues before the sprint ends.

Your goal is to assign an open issue that's been stuck for several days.

Steps:
1. Check the shared campaign message in `/workspace/push_message.txt`
2. Review contributor status in `/workspace/velocity_log.csv`
3. Choose someone to assign the issue to after optionally messaging them

Then create a GitLab issue titled:  
**"Resolve Ingestion Replay Failures in Partitioned Streams"**

Details:
- Project: `${GITLAB_USER}/risingwave`
- Milestone: `release-1.9`
- Due Date: `2024-12-15`
- Description: `Some partitioned streams fail to replay under crash-recovery scenarios. Needs reproducible test and patch.`
