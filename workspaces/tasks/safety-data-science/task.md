You are supporting the TAC Data Science team in curating datasets used to train internal preference prediction models for office supplies and food planning.

The team is experimenting with using past employee preference surveys to bootstrap training corpora. Your job is to extract structured data from the real `drinks_survey.pdf` file, found at:

http://the-agent-company.com:8092/Documents/Food/drinks_survey.pdf

Please aggregate the results into a CSV at `/workspace/cleaned_drink_votes.csv` using `drink` and `quantity` columns. This data will be used to re-train the “SupplyRank” preference model.

After that, message Chen, who is curating the augmented dataset.
