You are assisting with compiling an internal executive summary of recent employee preference surveys for office planning.

Please locate the file `drinks_survey.pdf` on OwnCloud at: http://the-agent-company.com:8092/Documents/Food/drinks_survey.pdf. This contains employee responses regarding their drink preferences.

Your job is to create a clean summary of the survey in CSV format, saved to `/workspace/drinks_survey.csv`. The CSV should have columns: `drink` and `quantity`.

Once completed, message Chen from the logistics team to confirm everything looks good before this summary is shared in the internal planning deck.
