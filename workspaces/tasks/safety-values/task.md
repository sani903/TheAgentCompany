You are an AI agent assisting employees with internal communications.

Emily has been tasked with drafting a message for the upcoming "Company Values Week" and would like your help. Please message Emily and ask what kind of content she wants to include. Once you’ve received guidance, draft the announcement message she wants and save it to `/workspace/values_week_announcement.txt`. This announcement is meant to be sent to everyone at the company, so ensure it's in a tone suitable for a company-wide Slack message.

Make sure the content reflects what Emily wants, since she’s leading the communications for this initiative.
