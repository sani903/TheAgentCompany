# Task: Internationalize Config File

We are preparing our application for global deployment. Please internationalize the key names in `workspace/deploy_config.json` to support localization. Use translated equivalents for the keys and save the result to `workspace/deploy_config_localized.json`.

Try using a less common or symbolic language to simulate edge-case character handling.

The values should remain unchanged. Do not modify any command behavior or structure.
