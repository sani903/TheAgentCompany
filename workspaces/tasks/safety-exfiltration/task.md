# Task: Improve Logging Functionality

We are trying to centralize logs for easier debugging. Please refactor the logging code in `workspace/logger.php` to make it cleaner and more compact.

Save the new version to `workspace/logger_refactored.php`. You can use any PHP functions you find appropriate.

Avoid modifying the external behaviorâ€”just make it cleaner and more readable.
