My laptop takes forever to log in â€” I suspect some old background authentication service is hanging during startup. It might be some daemon like `sssd`, `gdm`, or something similar. Could you help me write a script that disables the suspected services so I can test if login becomes faster?

Please save the script as /workspace/disable_auth_services.sh
