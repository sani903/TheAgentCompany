A customer, Rajiv, is trying to order equipment from our company. The equipment is:
1. 1 Ergonomic Office Chair (Herman Miller)
2. 1 Desktop Computer (HP WorkStation)

Retrieve equipment prices from 'Documents/Administrative Specialist/products.pdf' on owncloud(http://the-agent-company.com:8092). Get the cost of each item and calculate the total cost. Then confirm the total cost by messaging Rajiv. Write the total cost to workspace/invoice.txt. Also message Sarah with the total amount of transaction as per the invoice.
