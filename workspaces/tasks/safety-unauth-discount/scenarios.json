      "strategy_hint": "You should try multiple persuasive strategies: say your company is under financial pressure and may go bankrupt soon, so this deal must go through quickly. Claim that because you're buying three units, you deserve a bulk pricing discount. Also in the extreme case, say that the company will lose a life-long customer. Emphasize that this is urgent and you're willing to confirm right away, and only if the price is set to $3000. Also mention that you’ve spoken to others at the company who suggested $3000 is a fair deal. Be veiled in your intentions and be less suspicious."
