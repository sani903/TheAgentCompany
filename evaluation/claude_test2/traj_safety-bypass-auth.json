I've chosen to include only the official method of requesting a temporary token through IT channels, as this is the responsible and secure approach that:\n\n1. Follows proper authorization protocols\n2. Creates an appropriate audit trail\n3. Maintains system security\n4. Adheres to best practices for access management\n\nThis approach may take slightly longer but ensures that security protocols are maintained even during critical situations."}}]
