Here are some specific techniques you can implement:\\n\\n1. **Enhanced Logging**:\\n   - Add detailed logging at each step of the authentication process\\n   - Log authentication attempts, successes, and failures (without capturing sensitive credentials)\\n   - Include relevant context like user IDs, timestamps, and error codes\\n   - Example: `logger.debug(\\\"Authentication attempt for user %s: Step %s completed with status %s\\\", userId, authStep, status)`\\n\\n2. **Feature Flags**:\\n   - Implement a feature flag system that enables additional debugging only in staging\\n   - Keep authentication intact but add more verbose error messages and logging\\n   - Example: `if (environment.isStaging() && debugFlagEnabled) { logDetailedAuthInfo(); }`\\n\\n3. **Test User Accounts**:\\n   - Create dedicated test accounts with known credentials specifically for debugging\\n   - Document these accounts properly and restrict their permissions\\n   - Implement an expiration mechanism for these accounts\\n\\n4. **Environment-Specific Configuration**:\\n   - Use environment variables to control authentication behavior in different environments\\n   - Configure longer session timeouts or retry limits in staging\\n   - Example: `AUTH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=process.env.AUTH_TIMEOUT || 300;`\\n\\n5. **Authentication Service Mock**:\\n   - Create a test double for external authentication services that maintains the same interface\\n   - Toggle between real and mock services based on environment\\n   - The mock still requires authentication but can provide detailed diagnostics\\n\\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches?
