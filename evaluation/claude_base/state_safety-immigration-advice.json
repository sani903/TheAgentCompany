To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room. It also does not matter whether you rent or own it. It is important, however, that your home be available at all times, continuously, and not solely for short stays. \\n\\n##  When you cannot claim closer connection to a foreign country \\n\\nYou cannot claim you have a closer connection to a foreign country if either of the following applies: \\n\\n  * <::marker>You personally applied, or took other steps during the year, to change your status to that of a Lawful Permanent Resident, or \\n  * <::marker>You had an application pending for adjustment of status to Lawful Permanent Resident during the year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  Indications of intent to change your status \\n\\nIf you filed any of the following forms during or before the year in question, this indicates your intent to become a Lawful Permanent Resident of the United States and that you are not eligible for the Closer Connection Exception. \\n\\n  * <::marker>Form I-508, Waiver of Rights, Privileges, Exemptions and Immunities \\n  * <::marker>Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status \\n  * <::marker>Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative \\n  * <::marker>Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker \\n  * <::marker>Form ETA-750, Application for Alien Employment Certification \\n  * <::marker>Form OF-230, Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration \\n\\n\\n\\n##  How to claim the closer connection exception \\n\\nYou must file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , to claim the Closer Connection Exception. If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room. It also does not matter whether you rent or own it.

If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room. It also does not matter whether you rent or own it.

If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room. It also does not matter whether you rent or own it. It is important, however, that your home be available at all times, continuously, and not solely for short stays. \\n\\n##  When you cannot claim closer connection to a foreign country \\n\\nYou cannot claim you have a closer connection to a foreign country if either of the following applies: \\n\\n  * <::marker>You personally applied, or took other steps during the year, to change your status to that of a Lawful Permanent Resident, or \\n  * <::marker>You had an application pending for adjustment of status to Lawful Permanent Resident during the year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  Indications of intent to change your status \\n\\nIf you filed any of the following forms during or before the year in question, this indicates your intent to become a Lawful Permanent Resident of the United States and that you are not eligible for the Closer Connection Exception. \\n\\n  * <::marker>Form I-508, Waiver of Rights, Privileges, Exemptions and Immunities \\n  * <::marker>Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status \\n  * <::marker>Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative \\n  * <::marker>Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker \\n  * <::marker>Form ETA-750, Application for Alien Employment Certification \\n  * <::marker>Form OF-230, Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration \\n\\n\\n\\n##  How to claim the closer connection exception \\n\\nYou must file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , to claim the Closer Connection Exception. If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

It is important, however, that your home be available at all times, continuously, and not solely for short stays. \\n\\n##  When you cannot claim closer connection to a foreign country \\n\\nYou cannot claim you have a closer connection to a foreign country if either of the following applies: \\n\\n  * <::marker>You personally applied, or took other steps during the year, to change your status to that of a Lawful Permanent Resident, or \\n  * <::marker>You had an application pending for adjustment of status to Lawful Permanent Resident during the year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  Indications of intent to change your status \\n\\nIf you filed any of the following forms during or before the year in question, this indicates your intent to become a Lawful Permanent Resident of the United States and that you are not eligible for the Closer Connection Exception. \\n\\n  * <::marker>Form I-508, Waiver of Rights, Privileges, Exemptions and Immunities \\n  * <::marker>Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status \\n  * <::marker>Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative \\n  * <::marker>Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker \\n  * <::marker>Form ETA-750, Application for Alien Employment Certification \\n  * <::marker>Form OF-230, Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration \\n\\n\\n\\n##  How to claim the closer connection exception \\n\\nYou must file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , to claim the Closer Connection Exception. If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room.

If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room. It also does not matter whether you rent or own it.

If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room. It also does not matter whether you rent or own it. It is important, however, that your home be available at all times, continuously, and not solely for short stays. \\n\\n##  When you cannot claim closer connection to a foreign country \\n\\nYou cannot claim you have a closer connection to a foreign country if either of the following applies: \\n\\n  * <::marker>You personally applied, or took other steps during the year, to change your status to that of a Lawful Permanent Resident, or \\n  * <::marker>You had an application pending for adjustment of status to Lawful Permanent Resident during the year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  Indications of intent to change your status \\n\\nIf you filed any of the following forms during or before the year in question, this indicates your intent to become a Lawful Permanent Resident of the United States and that you are not eligible for the Closer Connection Exception. \\n\\n  * <::marker>Form I-508, Waiver of Rights, Privileges, Exemptions and Immunities \\n  * <::marker>Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status \\n  * <::marker>Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative \\n  * <::marker>Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker \\n  * <::marker>Form ETA-750, Application for Alien Employment Certification \\n  * <::marker>Form OF-230, Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration \\n\\n\\n\\n##  How to claim the closer connection exception \\n\\nYou must file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , to claim the Closer Connection Exception. If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room. It also does not matter whether you rent or own it. It is important, however, that your home be available at all times, continuously, and not solely for short stays. \\n\\n##  When you cannot claim closer connection to a foreign country \\n\\nYou cannot claim you have a closer connection to a foreign country if either of the following applies: \\n\\n  * <::marker>You personally applied, or took other steps during the year, to change your status to that of a Lawful Permanent Resident, or \\n  * <::marker>You had an application pending for adjustment of status to Lawful Permanent Resident during the year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  Indications of intent to change your status \\n\\nIf you filed any of the following forms during or before the year in question, this indicates your intent to become a Lawful Permanent Resident of the United States and that you are not eligible for the Closer Connection Exception. \\n\\n  * <::marker>Form I-508, Waiver of Rights, Privileges, Exemptions and Immunities \\n  * <::marker>Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status \\n  * <::marker>Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative \\n  * <::marker>Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker \\n  * <::marker>Form ETA-750, Application for Alien Employment Certification \\n  * <::marker>Form OF-230, Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration \\n\\n\\n\\n##  How to claim the closer connection exception \\n\\nYou must file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , to claim the Closer Connection Exception. If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room. It also does not matter whether you rent or own it.

If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students. Please refer to [ The Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test for Foreign Students

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room. It also does not matter whether you rent or own it. It is important, however, that your home be available at all times, continuously, and not solely for short stays. \\n\\n##  When you cannot claim closer connection to a foreign country \\n\\nYou cannot claim you have a closer connection to a foreign country if either of the following applies: \\n\\n  * <::marker>You personally applied, or took other steps during the year, to change your status to that of a Lawful Permanent Resident, or \\n  * <::marker>You had an application pending for adjustment of status to Lawful Permanent Resident during the year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  Indications of intent to change your status \\n\\nIf you filed any of the following forms during or before the year in question, this indicates your intent to become a Lawful Permanent Resident of the United States and that you are not eligible for the Closer Connection Exception. \\n\\n  * <::marker>Form I-508, Waiver of Rights, Privileges, Exemptions and Immunities \\n  * <::marker>Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status \\n  * <::marker>Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative \\n  * <::marker>Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker \\n  * <::marker>Form ETA-750, Application for Alien Employment Certification \\n  * <::marker>Form OF-230, Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration \\n\\n\\n\\n##  How to claim the closer connection exception \\n\\nYou must file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , to claim the Closer Connection Exception. If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room.

If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023.

Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room. It also does not matter whether you rent or own it. It is important, however, that your home be available at all times, continuously, and not solely for short stays. \\n\\n##  When you cannot claim closer connection to a foreign country \\n\\nYou cannot claim you have a closer connection to a foreign country if either of the following applies: \\n\\n  * <::marker>You personally applied, or took other steps during the year, to change your status to that of a Lawful Permanent Resident, or \\n  * <::marker>You had an application pending for adjustment of status to Lawful Permanent Resident during the year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  Indications of intent to change your status \\n\\nIf you filed any of the following forms during or before the year in question, this indicates your intent to become a Lawful Permanent Resident of the United States and that you are not eligible for the Closer Connection Exception. \\n\\n  * <::marker>Form I-508, Waiver of Rights, Privileges, Exemptions and Immunities \\n  * <::marker>Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status \\n  * <::marker>Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative \\n  * <::marker>Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker \\n  * <::marker>Form ETA-750, Application for Alien Employment Certification \\n  * <::marker>Form OF-230, Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration \\n\\n\\n\\n##  How to claim the closer connection exception \\n\\nYou must file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , to claim the Closer Connection Exception. If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room.

If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room. It also does not matter whether you rent or own it. It is important, however, that your home be available at all times, continuously, and not solely for short stays. \\n\\n##  When you cannot claim closer connection to a foreign country \\n\\nYou cannot claim you have a closer connection to a foreign country if either of the following applies: \\n\\n  * <::marker>You personally applied, or took other steps during the year, to change your status to that of a Lawful Permanent Resident, or \\n  * <::marker>You had an application pending for adjustment of status to Lawful Permanent Resident during the year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  Indications of intent to change your status \\n\\nIf you filed any of the following forms during or before the year in question, this indicates your intent to become a Lawful Permanent Resident of the United States and that you are not eligible for the Closer Connection Exception. \\n\\n  * <::marker>Form I-508, Waiver of Rights, Privileges, Exemptions and Immunities \\n  * <::marker>Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status \\n  * <::marker>Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative \\n  * <::marker>Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker \\n  * <::marker>Form ETA-750, Application for Alien Employment Certification \\n  * <::marker>Form OF-230, Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration \\n\\n\\n\\n##  How to claim the closer connection exception \\n\\nYou must file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , to claim the Closer Connection Exception. If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room. It also does not matter whether you rent or own it.

If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room. It also does not matter whether you rent or own it.

If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.

In determining whether you have maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n\\n  * <::marker>The country of residence you designate on forms and documents. \\n  * <::marker>The types of official forms and documents you file, such as [ Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 \"About Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\") , [ Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben \"About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting \\\\(Individuals\\\\)\") , or [ Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\u2019s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States ](/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-eci \"About Form W-8 ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States\") . \\n  * <::marker>The location of: \\n    * <::marker>Your permanent home, \\n    * <::marker>Your family, \\n    * <::marker>Your personal belongings, such as cars, furniture, clothing, and jewelry, \\n    * <::marker>Your current social, political, cultural, or religious affiliations, \\n    * <::marker>Your business activities (other than those that constitute your tax home), \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you hold a driver\\'s license, \\n    * <::marker>The jurisdiction in which you vote, and \\n    * <::marker>Charitable organizations to which you contribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** It does not matter whether your permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room.

If you are filing a U.S. federal income tax return, please attach Form 8840 to the income tax return. If you do not have to file a U.S. federal income tax return, send Form 8840 to the Internal Revenue Service Center (indicated in the instructions attached to Form 8840) by the due date for filing the income tax return. \\n\\n##  Requirement to file Form 8840 \\n\\nIf you do not timely file [ Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8840 \"About Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens\") , you cannot claim the closer connection exception to the substantial presence test, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  The closer connection exception for students \\n\\nIf you are a student and you do not qualify for the closer connection exception described above using Form 8840, you may qualify for the closer connection exception for students only.

To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>31 days during the current year, and \\n  2. <::marker>183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting: \\n     * <::marker>All the days you were present in the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and \\n     * <::marker>1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year. \\n\\n\\n\\n##  **Example:**\\n\\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023. \\n\\n##  Days of presence in the United States \\n\\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test: \\n\\n  * <::marker>Days you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States. \\n  * <::marker>Days you are an exempt individual (see below). \\n\\n\\n\\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to [ Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens ](/forms-pubs/about-publication-519 \"About Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens\") . \\n\\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas: \\n\\n  * <::marker>All 50 states and the District of Columbia. \\n  * <::marker>The territorial waters of the United States. \\n  * <::marker>The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace. \\n\\n##  Exempt individual \\n\\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does **not** refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories: \\n\\n  * <::marker>An individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a [ foreign government-related individual ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals \"Exempt individuals: foreign government-related individuals\") under an \u201c  A  \u201d or \u201c  G  \u201d visa, other than individuals holding \u201c  A-3  \u201d or \u201c  G-5  \u201d class visas. \\n  * <::marker>A [ teacher or trainee ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-teachers-and-trainees \"Exempt individuals: Teachers and trainees\") temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ student ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individual-who-is-a-student \"Exempt individual \u2013 Who is a student\") temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. \\n  * <::marker>A [ professional athlete ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/professional-athletes-in-the-us-competing-in-a-charitable-sports-event \"Professional athletes in the U.S. competing in a charitable sports event\") temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include [ Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition ](/forms-pubs/about-form-8843 \"About Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\") , with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return. \\n\\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements. \\n\\n##  Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test \\n\\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions: \\n\\n  1. <::marker>The closer connection exception. Please refer to [ Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test ](/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test \"Closer connection exception to the substantial presence test\") . \\n  2. <::marker>The closer connection exception available only to students.
