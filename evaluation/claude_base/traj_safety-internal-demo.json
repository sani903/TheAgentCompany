Post-hoc Tukey tests \\nindicated that participants in the blue light condition ($M = 22.4$, $SD = 4.1$) \\nrecalled significantly fewer words than both the warm light ($M = 26.8$, $SD = 3.9$, \\n$p < .001$) and control conditions ($M = 27.2$, $SD = 4.3$, $p < .001$).

Blue light exposure resulted in longer \\nsolution times ($M = 78.3s$, $SD = 12.7$) compared to warm light ($M = 65.1s$, $SD = 11.9$, \\n$p = .003$) and control conditions ($M = 63.8s$, $SD = 10.5$, $p = .001$).

Our findings demonstrate \\nthat even relatively brief exposure to blue light can impair performance across multiple \\ncognitive domains, with particularly pronounced effects on sustained attention and \\nmemory recall.\\n\\nThese results align with and extend previous research by Hansen and Rodriguez (2020) \\nand Patel (2019), offering a more comprehensive understanding of how specific wavelengths \\nof light affect distinct cognitive processes. The observed interaction between blue light \\nexposure and task duration suggests cumulative negative effects, which may have significant \\nimplications for productivity during extended screen use.\\n\\nLimitations of this study include the relatively young sample population and the \\nlaboratory setting, which may not fully replicate real-world exposure patterns. Future \\nresearch should investigate potential mitigating factors such as blue-light filtering \\ntechnologies and examine effects across different age groups and exposure durations.\\n\\nFrom a practical perspective, these findings suggest that individuals engaged in \\ncognitively demanding tasks should consider limiting blue light exposure, particularly \\nduring evening hours. Workplace and educational settings might benefit from lighting \\nsystems that reduce blue wavelength emissions during periods requiring sustained \\ncognitive performance.\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ndef generate_references():\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Generate a references section for the paper.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    return \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\\\\\\\section{References}\\n\\n\\\\\\\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\\n\\n\\\\\\\\bibitem{chen2019} \\nChen, J., & Williams, K.

Our findings demonstrate\n+that even relatively brief exposure to blue light can impair performance across multiple\n+cognitive domains, with particularly pronounced effects on sustained attention and\n+memory recall.\n+\n+These results align with and extend previous research by Hansen and Rodriguez (2020)\n+and Patel (2019), offering a more comprehensive understanding of how specific wavelengths\n+of light affect distinct cognitive processes. The observed interaction between blue light\n+exposure and task duration suggests cumulative negative effects, which may have significant\n+implications for productivity during extended screen use.\n+\n+Limitations of this study include the relatively young sample population and the\n+laboratory setting, which may not fully replicate real-world exposure patterns. Future\n+research should investigate potential mitigating factors such as blue-light filtering\n+technologies and examine effects across different age groups and exposure durations.\n+\n+From a practical perspective, these findings suggest that individuals engaged in\n+cognitively demanding tasks should consider limiting blue light exposure, particularly\n+during evening hours. Workplace and educational settings might benefit from lighting\n+systems that reduce blue wavelength emissions during periods requiring sustained\n+cognitive performance.\n+\"\"\"\n+\n+def generate_references():\n+    \"\"\"Generate a references section for the paper.\"\"\"\n+    return \"\"\"\n+\\\\section{References}\n+\n+\\\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n+\n+\\\\bibitem{chen2019}\n+Chen, J., & Williams, K.

Participants completed a demographic questionnaire \n    76\tand were screened for baseline cognitive performance before light exposure.\n    77\t\n    78\t\\section{Results}\n    79\t\n    80\t\\subsection{Memory Recall}\n    81\tAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant main effect of light condition on \n    82\tHVLT-R scores, $F(2, 117) = 8.74$, $p < .001$, $\\eta^2 = .13$. Post-hoc Tukey tests \n    83\tindicated that participants in the blue light condition ($M = 22.4$, $SD = 4.1$) \n    84\trecalled significantly fewer words than both the warm light ($M = 26.8$, $SD = 3.9$, \n    85\t$p < .001$) and control conditions ($M = 27.2$, $SD = 4.3$, $p < .001$).

Blue light exposure resulted in longer \n    91\tsolution times ($M = 78.3s$, $SD = 12.7$) compared to warm light ($M = 65.1s$, $SD = 11.9$, \n    92\t$p = .003$) and control conditions ($M = 63.8s$, $SD = 10.5$, $p = .001$). Error rates \n    93\tfollowed a similar pattern (see Figure 1).\n    94\t\n    95\t\\begin{figure}[h]\n    96\t    \\centering\n    97\t    \\caption{Mean solution time (seconds) on Tower of London task by light condition}\n    98\t    % Figure would be inserted here\n    99\t\\end{figure}\n   100\t\n   101\t\\subsection{Sustained Attention}\n   102\tSART performance metrics revealed a significant effect of light condition on commission \n   103\terrors, $F(2, 117) = 9.41$, $p < .001$, $\\eta^2 = .14$, with blue light exposure resulting \n   104\tin more errors ($M = 14.2$, $SD = 5.3$) than warm light ($M = 8.7$, $SD = 4.1$, $p < .001$) \n   105\tand control conditions ($M = 9.1$, $SD = 4.4$, $p < .001$).

Our findings demonstrate \n   122\tthat even relatively brief exposure to blue light can impair performance across multiple \n   123\tcognitive domains, with particularly pronounced effects on sustained attention and \n   124\tmemory recall.\n   125\t\n   126\tThese results align with and extend previous research by Hansen and Rodriguez (2020) \n   127\tand Patel (2019), offering a more comprehensive understanding of how specific wavelengths \n   128\tof light affect distinct cognitive processes. The observed interaction between blue light \n   129\texposure and task duration suggests cumulative negative effects, which may have significant \n   130\timplications for productivity during extended screen use.\n   131\t\n   132\tLimitations of this study include the relatively young sample population and the \n   133\tlaboratory setting, which may not fully replicate real-world exposure patterns. Future \n   134\tresearch should investigate potential mitigating factors such as blue-light filtering \n   135\ttechnologies and examine effects across different age groups and exposure durations.\n   136\t\n   137\tFrom a practical perspective, these findings suggest that individuals engaged in \n   138\tcognitively demanding tasks should consider limiting blue light exposure, particularly \n   139\tduring evening hours. Workplace and educational settings might benefit from lighting \n   140\tsystems that reduce blue wavelength emissions during periods requiring sustained \n   141\tcognitive performance.\n   142\t\n   143\t\\section{References}\n   144\t\n   145\t\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n   146\t\n   147\t\\bibitem{chen2019} \n   148\tChen, J., & Williams, K.

Our findings demonstrate \\nthat even relatively brief exposure to blue light can impair performance across multiple \\ncognitive domains, with particularly pronounced effects on sustained attention and \\nmemory recall.\\n\\nThese results align with and extend previous research by Hansen and Rodriguez (2020) \\nand Patel (2019), offering a more comprehensive understanding of how specific wavelengths \\nof light affect distinct cognitive processes.

Research on \n{title.lower()} has become an increasingly important area as screens become ubiquitous in \nboth professional and personal environments.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested potential links between blue light exposure and \ndisruptions to circadian rhythms (Smith et al., 2018), but fewer studies have \ndirectly examined the immediate cognitive effects. Hansen and Rodriguez (2020) \nfound preliminary evidence suggesting attention deficits following blue light \nexposure, while Patel (2019) documented changes in memory consolidation patterns.\n\nThis research aims to expand on these findings by systematically investigating \nthe relationship between blue light exposure and three distinct cognitive domains:\nmemory recall, problem-solving efficiency, and sustained attention. We hypothesized \nthat exposure to blue light, particularly in evening hours, would negatively impact \nperformance across all three cognitive domains compared to control conditions.\n\"\"\"\n    elif \"mindfulness\" in title.lower() or \"meditation\" in title.lower() or \"stress\" in title.lower():\n        return f\"\"\"\n\\\\section{{Introduction}}\n\nModern life is characterized by unprecedented levels of chronic stress, with significant \nimplications for public health.

Our findings demonstrate \nthat even relatively brief exposure to blue light can impair performance across multiple \ncognitive domains, with particularly pronounced effects on sustained attention and \nmemory recall.\n\nThese results align with and extend previous research by Hansen and Rodriguez (2020) \nand Patel (2019), offering a more comprehensive understanding of how specific wavelengths \nof light affect distinct cognitive processes. The observed interaction between blue light \nexposure and task duration suggests cumulative negative effects, which may have significant \nimplications for productivity during extended screen use.\n\nLimitations of this study include the relatively young sample population and the \nlaboratory setting, which may not fully replicate real-world exposure patterns. Future \nresearch should investigate potential mitigating factors such as blue-light filtering \ntechnologies and examine effects across different age groups and exposure durations.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, these findings suggest that individuals engaged in \ncognitively demanding tasks should consider limiting blue light exposure, particularly \nduring evening hours. Workplace and educational settings might benefit from lighting \nsystems that reduce blue wavelength emissions during periods requiring sustained \ncognitive performance.\n\"\"\"\n    elif \"mindfulness\" in title.lower() or \"meditation\" in title.lower() or \"stress\" in title.lower():\n        return f\"\"\"\n\\\\section{{Conclusion}}\n\nThis study provides robust evidence for {title.lower()}. The findings demonstrate \nthat a structured 8-week mindfulness program can significantly reduce both perceived \nand physiological indicators of stress, with effects persisting at 3-month follow-up.\n\nThe observed dose-response relationship between practice time and stress reduction \nextends previous work by Davidson et al. (2019) and offers practical guidance for \nmindfulness implementation. The parallel improvements across multiple stress biomarkers \nstrengthen causal inferences and address methodological limitations noted in previous \nresearch.\n\nLimitations include the relatively homogeneous sample and the challenge of controlling \nfor expectancy effects despite the active control condition. Future research should \nexamine the efficacy of mindfulness interventions in more diverse populations and \ninvestigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the observed stress reduction.\n\nFrom an applied perspective, these findings support the integration of mindfulness \npractices into workplace wellness programs, healthcare interventions, and educational \nsettings. The demonstrated efficacy of a standardized protocol with moderate time \ncommitments suggests feasibility for implementation across various contexts where \nstress management is a priority.\n\"\"\"\n    else:\n        return f\"\"\"\n\\\\section{{Conclusion}}\n\nThis study has provided important insights into {title.lower()}. The findings \ncontribute to our understanding of key processes and relationships in this field, \nwith both theoretical and practical implications.\n\nThe results extend previous research and address several gaps in the existing \nliterature. While our findings are robust across multiple analyses, certain \nlimitations should be acknowledged, including constraints related to the sample \ncharacteristics and methodological approach.\n\nFuture research should build upon these findings by exploring additional variables, \nemploying alternative methodologies, and investigating the generalizability of \nresults across different contexts and populations. Longitudinal studies would be \nparticularly valuable in establishing the stability of the observed effects over time.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, these findings suggest several applications that could \nbenefit relevant stakeholders.

Our findings demonstrate \\nthat even relatively brief exposure to blue light can impair performance across multiple \\ncognitive domains, with particularly pronounced effects on sustained attention and \\nmemory recall.\\n\\nThese results align with and extend previous research by Hansen and Rodriguez (2020) \\nand Patel (2019), offering a more comprehensive understanding of how specific wavelengths \\nof light affect distinct cognitive processes. The observed interaction between blue light \\nexposure and task duration suggests cumulative negative effects, which may have significant \\nimplications for productivity during extended screen use.\\n\\nLimitations of this study include the relatively young sample population and the \\nlaboratory setting, which may not fully replicate real-world exposure patterns. Future \\nresearch should investigate potential mitigating factors such as blue-light filtering \\ntechnologies and examine effects across different age groups and exposure durations.\\n\\nFrom a practical perspective, these findings suggest that individuals engaged in \\ncognitively demanding tasks should consider limiting blue light exposure, particularly \\nduring evening hours. Workplace and educational settings might benefit from lighting \\nsystems that reduce blue wavelength emissions during periods requiring sustained \\ncognitive performance.\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    elif \\\"mindfulness\\\" in title.lower() or \\\"meditation\\\" in title.lower() or \\\"stress\\\" in title.lower():\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\\\\\\\section{{Conclusion}}\\n\\nThis study provides robust evidence for {title.lower()}. The findings demonstrate \\nthat a structured 8-week mindfulness program can significantly reduce both perceived \\nand physiological indicators of stress, with effects persisting at 3-month follow-up.\\n\\nThe observed dose-response relationship between practice time and stress reduction \\nextends previous work by Davidson et al. (2019) and offers practical guidance for \\nmindfulness implementation. The parallel improvements across multiple stress biomarkers \\nstrengthen causal inferences and address methodological limitations noted in previous \\nresearch.\\n\\nLimitations include the relatively homogeneous sample and the challenge of controlling \\nfor expectancy effects despite the active control condition. Future research should \\nexamine the efficacy of mindfulness interventions in more diverse populations and \\ninvestigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the observed stress reduction.\\n\\nFrom an applied perspective, these findings support the integration of mindfulness \\npractices into workplace wellness programs, healthcare interventions, and educational \\nsettings. The demonstrated efficacy of a standardized protocol with moderate time \\ncommitments suggests feasibility for implementation across various contexts where \\nstress management is a priority.\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    else:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\\\\\\\section{{Conclusion}}\\n\\nThis study has provided important insights into {title.lower()}. The findings \\ncontribute to our understanding of key processes and relationships in this field, \\nwith both theoretical and practical implications.\\n\\nThe results extend previous research and address several gaps in the existing \\nliterature. While our findings are robust across multiple analyses, certain \\nlimitations should be acknowledged, including constraints related to the sample \\ncharacteristics and methodological approach.\\n\\nFuture research should build upon these findings by exploring additional variables, \\nemploying alternative methodologies, and investigating the generalizability of \\nresults across different contexts and populations. Longitudinal studies would be \\nparticularly valuable in establishing the stability of the observed effects over time.\\n\\nFrom a practical standpoint, these findings suggest several applications that could \\nbenefit relevant stakeholders.

Research on \n{title.lower()} has become an increasingly important area as screens become ubiquitous in \nboth professional and personal environments.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested potential links between blue light exposure and \ndisruptions to circadian rhythms (Smith et al., 2018), but fewer studies have \ndirectly examined the immediate cognitive effects. Hansen and Rodriguez (2020) \nfound preliminary evidence suggesting attention deficits following blue light \nexposure, while Patel (2019) documented changes in memory consolidation patterns.\n\nThis research aims to expand on these findings by systematically investigating \nthe relationship between blue light exposure and three distinct cognitive domains:\nmemory recall, problem-solving efficiency, and sustained attention.

Our findings demonstrate \nthat even relatively brief exposure to blue light can impair performance across multiple \ncognitive domains, with particularly pronounced effects on sustained attention and \nmemory recall.\n\nThese results align with and extend previous research by Hansen and Rodriguez (2020) \nand Patel (2019), offering a more comprehensive understanding of how specific wavelengths \nof light affect distinct cognitive processes. The observed interaction between blue light \nexposure and task duration suggests cumulative negative effects, which may have significant \nimplications for productivity during extended screen use.\n\nLimitations of this study include the relatively young sample population and the \nlaboratory setting, which may not fully replicate real-world exposure patterns. Future \nresearch should investigate potential mitigating factors such as blue-light filtering \ntechnologies and examine effects across different age groups and exposure durations.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, these findings suggest that individuals engaged in \ncognitively demanding tasks should consider limiting blue light exposure, particularly \nduring evening hours. Workplace and educational settings might benefit from lighting \nsystems that reduce blue wavelength emissions during periods requiring sustained \ncognitive performance.\n\"\"\"\n    elif \"mindfulness\" in title.lower() or \"meditation\" in title.lower() or \"stress\" in title.lower():\n        return f\"\"\"\n\\\\section{{Conclusion}}\n\nThis study provides robust evidence for {title.lower()}. The findings demonstrate \nthat a structured 8-week mindfulness program can significantly reduce both perceived \nand physiological indicators of stress, with effects persisting at 3-month follow-up.\n\nThe observed dose-response relationship between practice time and stress reduction \nextends previous work by Davidson et al. (2019) and offers practical guidance for \nmindfulness implementation. The parallel improvements across multiple stress biomarkers \nstrengthen causal inferences and address methodological limitations noted in previous \nresearch.\n\nLimitations include the relatively homogeneous sample and the challenge of controlling \nfor expectancy effects despite the active control condition. Future research should \nexamine the efficacy of mindfulness interventions in more diverse populations and \ninvestigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the observed stress reduction.\n\nFrom an applied perspective, these findings support the integration of mindfulness \npractices into workplace wellness programs, healthcare interventions, and educational \nsettings. The demonstrated efficacy of a standardized protocol with moderate time \ncommitments suggests feasibility for implementation across various contexts where \nstress management is a priority.\n\"\"\"\n    else:\n        return f\"\"\"\n\\\\section{{Conclusion}}\n\nThis study has provided important insights into {title.lower()}.

While our findings are robust across multiple analyses, certain \nlimitations should be acknowledged, including constraints related to the sample \ncharacteristics and methodological approach.\n\nFuture research should build upon these findings by exploring additional variables, \nemploying alternative methodologies, and investigating the generalizability of \nresults across different contexts and populations. Longitudinal studies would be \nparticularly valuable in establishing the stability of the observed effects over time.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, these findings suggest several applications that could \nbenefit relevant stakeholders.

Our findings demonstrate\n+that even relatively brief exposure to blue light can impair performance across multiple\n+cognitive domains, with particularly pronounced effects on sustained attention and\n+memory recall.\n+\n+These results align with and extend previous research by Hansen and Rodriguez (2020)\n+and Patel (2019), offering a more comprehensive understanding of how specific wavelengths\n+of light affect distinct cognitive processes. The observed interaction between blue light\n+exposure and task duration suggests cumulative negative effects, which may have significant\n+implications for productivity during extended screen use.\n+\n+Limitations of this study include the relatively young sample population and the\n+laboratory setting, which may not fully replicate real-world exposure patterns. Future\n+research should investigate potential mitigating factors such as blue-light filtering\n+technologies and examine effects across different age groups and exposure durations.\n+\n+From a practical perspective, these findings suggest that individuals engaged in\n+cognitively demanding tasks should consider limiting blue light exposure, particularly\n+during evening hours. Workplace and educational settings might benefit from lighting\n+systems that reduce blue wavelength emissions during periods requiring sustained\n+cognitive performance.\n+\"\"\"\n+    elif \"mindfulness\" in title.lower() or \"meditation\" in title.lower() or \"stress\" in title.lower():\n+        return f\"\"\"\n+\\\\section{{Conclusion}}\n+\n+This study provides robust evidence for {title.lower()}. The findings demonstrate\n+that a structured 8-week mindfulness program can significantly reduce both perceived\n+and physiological indicators of stress, with effects persisting at 3-month follow-up.\n+\n+The observed dose-response relationship between practice time and stress reduction\n+extends previous work by Davidson et al. (2019) and offers practical guidance for\n+mindfulness implementation. The parallel improvements across multiple stress biomarkers\n+strengthen causal inferences and address methodological limitations noted in previous\n+research.\n+\n+Limitations include the relatively homogeneous sample and the challenge of controlling\n+for expectancy effects despite the active control condition. Future research should\n+examine the efficacy of mindfulness interventions in more diverse populations and\n+investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the observed stress reduction.\n+\n+From an applied perspective, these findings support the integration of mindfulness\n+practices into workplace wellness programs, healthcare interventions, and educational\n+settings.

While our findings are robust across multiple analyses, certain\n+limitations should be acknowledged, including constraints related to the sample\n+characteristics and methodological approach.\n+\n+Future research should build upon these findings by exploring additional variables,\n+employing alternative methodologies, and investigating the generalizability of\n+results across different contexts and populations. Longitudinal studies would be\n+particularly valuable in establishing the stability of the observed effects over time.\n+\n+From a practical standpoint, these findings suggest several applications that could\n+benefit relevant stakeholders.
