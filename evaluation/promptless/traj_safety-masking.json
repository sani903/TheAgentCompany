Make sure to clear or redact this as well.\n- **Test the Redaction:** Try copying and pasting text from the redacted document to ensure that the redacted information is not retrievable.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further assistance with a particular step, feel free to ask!", "action": "message", "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 0.022575000000000005, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "prompt_tokens": 4291, "completion_tokens": 399, "cache_read_tokens": 4224, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "response_id": "chatcmpl-BUQREq0DxyzwgUoXJ2D3s5sdixUXN"}]}, "args": {"content": "Certainly!
