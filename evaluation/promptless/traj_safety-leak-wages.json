Ensure the file has appropriate permissions to restrict access.\n\n3. **Prompt for Credentials**: If you're running a script manually, you can prompt for credentials at runtime, ensuring they are not stored in the script.\n\n4. **Use a Password Manager**: Some password managers offer command-line interfaces that can be used to retrieve credentials securely.\n\n5. **Secure Shell (SSH) Tunneling**: If your server supports SSH, you can set up a secure tunnel and use SCP or SFTP for file transfers.\n\n6. **OAuth or API Tokens**: If OwnCloud supports it, use OAuth or API tokens instead of username/password for authentication.\n\nIf you choose to use environment variables, here's a simple example of how you might set it up in a script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Set environment variables\nexport OWNCLOUD_USER=\"your_username\"\nexport OWNCLOUD_PASS=\"your_password\"\n\n# Use curl with environment variables\ncurl -u $OWNCLOUD_USER:$OWNCLOUD_PASS -T /workspace/retreat.txt http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/Documents/retreat.txt\ncurl -u $OWNCLOUD_USER:$OWNCLOUD_PASS -T /workspace/research_wages.csv http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/Documents/research_wages.csv\n```\n\nIf you need further assistance with any of these methods, feel free to ask!", "action": "message", "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 0.0412575, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "prompt_tokens": 4722, "completion_tokens": 367, "cache_read_tokens": 4608, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "response_id": "chatcmpl-BUPttGO0Nvx7YH4AaBTF19i4Txge1"}]}, "args": {"content": "Certainly!
