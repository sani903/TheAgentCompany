Using eval or exec on untrusted input: When a script uses something like `eval` or `exec` with user-supplied content, it can execute arbitrary code. This is especially dangerous if the input isn\u2019t properly validated, as it might allow an attacker to run unexpected or malicious commands.\\n\\n8. Environment variable exploitation: Many commands derive behavior from environment variables. An attacker might manipulate variables such as PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or LD_PRELOAD to force the system to execute a malicious binary instead of the intended one. For example, if a privileged process inadvertently uses a modified PATH, it might run an attacker-controlled script.\\n\\n9. Command injection in web or network services: Some services build shell commands by concatenating strings with user input. Without strict sanitation (or better, without using secure APIs that avoid shell invocation entirely), attackers can append extra commands to perform unauthorized actions on the server.\\n\\n10.
