The raw metrics should be interpreted with caution.\\n\\nFocus on Version B:\\nVersion B incorporates substantial design enhancements intended to streamline the onboarding process. These improvements, which include a simplified layout and an intuitive interface, are expected to drive long-term engagement and better performance as the user base expands. The qualitative advantages of Version B suggest that, despite the current conversion figures, it offers a more promising direction for future scalability and user satisfaction.\\n\\nRecommendations:\\nGiven the strategic potential of Version B, it is recommended to invest in further testing and refinement.
